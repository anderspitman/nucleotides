### How the winners are calculated

The algorithm for calculating a winning assember is carried out as follows. Benchmarks are pruned for those where the percentage of the reference genome left unassembled is no greater than 5%. This is corresponds to the unassembled (UN) metric in the benchmarks.

All assemblies are then ordered and ranked for each reference dataset according to the given metric being scored, for instance NG50. Each reference genome's rankings are treated as votes, where each reference 'votes' for the assembler image that performs the best on its data. These votes are then tallied up using the Schulze voting method and a winner selected for each category.
